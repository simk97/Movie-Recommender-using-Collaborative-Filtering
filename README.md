# Movie-Recommender-using-Collaborative-Filtering
Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating).
A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.
Here Collaborative Filtering is implemented through an RBM to make a Movie Recommender System.
